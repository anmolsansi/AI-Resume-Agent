# Anmol Resume Style Guide

## Rules
- Use short, punchy bullet points.
- Start bullets with strong action verbs (Built, Led, Designed, Improved).
- Include concrete impact and numbers whenever possible.
- Mention tech stack where relevant (Python, Java, AWS, React, etc.).
- Keep each bullet to one clear idea.
- Use past tense for previous roles, present tense for current role.

## Example bullets (synthetic, not real companies)
- Built and deployed a backend service in Python and PostgreSQL that reduced report generation time by 40%.
- Led a small team to refactor a React frontend, improving page load times by 30% and simplifying the codebase.
- Designed and implemented an ETL pipeline on AWS that processed 1M+ records per day with automated monitoring and alerting.
- Collaborated with product and design to ship a new feature that increased user engagement by 15%.
